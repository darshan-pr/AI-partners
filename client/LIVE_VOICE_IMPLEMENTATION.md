# 🎙️ StudyBuddy Live Voice Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the Live Voice Chat feature for StudyBuddy with multi-agent support. The system enables real-time voice interaction with StudyBuddy's AI agents using WebSockets, speech recognition, and text-to-speech.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **LiveVoiceInterface** - Main voice control button and status indicator
2. **LiveVoiceModal** - Full-screen voice chat interface with animations
3. **GeminiLiveAnimations** - Visual feedback for voice interactions
4. **WebSocket API** - Real-time communication backend

### Data Flow

```
User Voice Input → Speech Recognition → WebSocket → Agent System → Response → Text-to-Speech → User Audio Output
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. WebSocket Server (`/api/studybuddy-voice-live/route.js`)

**Features:**
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Session management without message persistence
- Multi-agent routing support
- Concise response optimization for voice

**Key Functions:**
- `initWebSocketServer()` - Initializes WebSocket server on port 8080
- `handleVoiceMessage()` - Routes incoming voice messages
- `handleMultiAgentVoice()` - Processes voice through agent system
- `handleSingleAgentVoice()` - Direct Gemini response for single-agent mode

**Message Types:**
```javascript
// Client to Server
{
  type: 'init_session',
  data: { username, multiAgentMode }
}

{
  type: 'voice_input', 
  data: { transcript }
}

// Server to Client
{
  type: 'voice_response',
  response: 'AI response text',
  mode: 'multi-agent',
  agentType: 'quiz',
  agentStatus: {...}
}
```

### 2. Live Voice Interface (`LiveVoiceInterface.jsx`)

**Features:**
- WebSocket connection management
- Speech recognition integration
- Text-to-speech synthesis
- Audio level visualization
- Real-time status indicators

**States:**
- `isConnected` - WebSocket connection status
- `isListening` - Speech recognition active
- `isProcessing` - Agent processing request
- `isSpeaking` - TTS playback active

### 3. Voice Modal (`LiveVoiceModal.jsx`)

**Features:**
- Full-screen voice experience
- Minimize/maximize functionality
- Volume controls
- Microphone toggle
- Visual animations with agent feedback

### 4. Gemini Live Animations (`GeminiLiveAnimations.jsx`)

**Animation States:**
- **Listening** - Concentric circles with audio-reactive scaling
- **Processing** - Rotating particles around center
- **Speaking** - Sound wave visualization
- **Idle** - Gentle glow effect

**Multi-Agent Visual Feedback:**
- Agent-specific color schemes
- Agent type indicators
- Specialized animations per agent

## 🎯 Multi-Agent Integration

### Agent Routing

The voice system fully integrates with StudyBuddy's multi-agent architecture:

1. **Orchestrator Agent** - Analyzes voice input and routes to appropriate agent
2. **Quiz Agent** - Handles quiz-related voice commands
3. **General Study Agent** - Manages general study questions
4. **Tutor Agent** - Provides performance analysis and suggestions

### Voice-Optimized Responses

Responses are automatically optimized for voice interaction:
- Concise, conversational tone
- Removal of complex formatting
- Emphasis on clarity and brevity
- Natural speech patterns

## 📱 User Interface Integration

### ChatInput Integration

The voice interface is integrated directly into the ChatInput component:
- Live voice button in input area
- Real-time connection status
- Agent indicators for multi-agent mode
- Seamless modal trigger

### Visual Feedback

- Connection status indicators
- Audio level visualization
- Agent type display
- Processing state animations

## 🔊 Audio Processing

### Speech Recognition
- Browser Web Speech API
- Continuous listening mode
- Real-time transcript processing
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Text-to-Speech
- Browser Speech Synthesis API
- Configurable voice settings
- Volume control
- Interrupt handling

### Audio Visualization
- Real-time audio level detection
- Visual feedback during listening
- Reactive animations based on audio input

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. No Message Persistence
- Voice interactions are not stored in database
- Temporary conversation buffer for context
- Privacy-focused design
- Lightweight operation

### 2. Real-Time Processing
- WebSocket-based communication
- Instant agent routing
- Live status updates
- Minimal latency

### 3. Multi-Agent Support
- Full orchestrator integration
- Agent-specific visual feedback
- Specialized routing for voice
- Context-aware responses

### 4. Interactive Animations
- Gemini Live-style animations
- Audio-reactive visualizations
- Agent-specific color schemes
- Smooth state transitions

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Dependencies
```bash
npm install ws
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY_CHAT` - For AI responses
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - For agent system

### 3. WebSocket Server
The WebSocket server is automatically initialized when the voice interface is first used.

### 4. Browser Permissions
Users need to grant:
- Microphone access for speech recognition
- Audio playback for text-to-speech

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Efficient WebSocket Management
- Single connection per session
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Connection pooling ready

### 2. Audio Processing
- Real-time audio analysis
- Minimal CPU usage
- Efficient visualization updates

### 3. Response Optimization
- Concise AI responses
- Voice-friendly formatting
- Reduced bandwidth usage

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### 1. No Message Storage
- Voice conversations are not persisted
- Temporary context only
- Privacy by design

### 2. WebSocket Security
- Connection validation
- Session management
- Error handling

### 3. Browser Security
- Secure audio permissions
- HTTPS requirement for production
- CSP compliance

## 🎨 Customization

### Agent Colors
```javascript
const getAgentColor = (agent) => {
  switch (agent) {
    case 'orchestrator': return { primary: 'purple', secondary: 'violet' };
    case 'quiz': return { primary: 'blue', secondary: 'indigo' };
    case 'general': return { primary: 'green', secondary: 'emerald' };
    case 'tutor': return { primary: 'orange', secondary: 'amber' };
  }
};
```

### 2. Voice Interaction
1. User starts speaking
2. Speech is converted to text
3. Text sent via WebSocket
4. Agent system processes request
5. Response generated and optimized
6. Text-to-speech plays response

### 3. Multi-Agent Flow

2. Routes to appropriate specialized agent
3. Agent processes and responds
4. Visual feedback shows current agent
5. Response optimized for voice delivery

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - Check if server is running
   - Verify port 8080 is available
