# Pull Request: Fix Deployment Issues & Implement Semester-Based Resource Sharing

## 🎯 Overview
This PR fixes critical deployment issues and implements semester-based resource sharing for the Knowledge Nest feature as requested.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Deployment Build Failures**
- **Issue**: Build failing due to missing dependencies and import errors
- **Fix**: 
  - Installed missing npm dependencies
  - Fixed component import paths (`VoiceAnimationDemo`)
  - Replaced non-existent `Lightning` icon with `Zap` from lucide-react
  - Added conditional environment variable checks for Convex client initialization
  - Made pdf-parse library import conditional to prevent missing test file errors

### 2. **Knowledge Nest File Upload Not Working**
- **Issue**: File upload functionality was incomplete and non-functional
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented proper Convex `generateUploadUrl` integration
  - Fixed file metadata storage in database
  - Added proper error handling and validation
  - Implemented secure download functionality with access control

### 3. **Incorrect Resource Sharing Scope**
- **Issue**: Resources were being filtered by organization + class + semester
- **Requirement**: Share resources only within same organization + branch + semester
- **Fix**: Completely removed `class_sec` field and implemented semester-only filtering

## 🚀 New Features

### Semester-Based Resource Sharing
- **Organization Verification**: Added semester selection (1st-8th semester) to verification form
- **Access Control**: Files now filtered by organization + branch + semester combination
- **UI Updates**: Dashboard shows semester instead of class information
- **Database Schema**: Updated to support semester-based filtering with optimized indexes

## 📝 Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- **Schema Updates**: 
  - Removed `class_sec` field from `org` and `knowledge_nest` tables
  - Added compound indexes for optimal semester-based querying
  - Added semester field to organization and file metadata

- **Convex Functions**:
  - Updated `createOrUpdateOrg` to handle semester parameter
  - Modified `getKnowledgeNestFiles` to filter by org + branch + semester
  - Fixed all file access control functions
  - Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

### Frontend Changes
- **Organization Verification Form**:
  - Removed class/section input field
  - Added semester dropdown with options (1st-8th semester)
  - Updated validation to require semester selection

- **Knowledge Nest Dashboard**:
  - Updated organization stats to show semester instead of class
  - Modified file display to show semester information
  - Updated file upload modal organization details

- **Components Updated**:
  - `app/home/knowledge-nest/page.jsx`
  - `components/FileUploadModal.jsx` 
  - `components/FileDisplayComponent.jsx`
  - `components/KnowledgeNestFileSelector.jsx`

### Build & Deployment Fixes
- **Environment Setup**: Created `.env.local.example` with required variables
- **API Routes**: Added Convex client initialization checks
- **Import Fixes**: Corrected component import paths
- **Icon Fixes**: Replaced `Lightning` with `Zap` throughout codebase

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Database Optimization
```javascript
// Added optimized compound index
.index("by_org_branch_semester", ["organization_id", "branch", "semester"])
```

### Access Control Enhancement
- Files now only accessible to users with exact same:
  - Organization ID
  - Branch
  - Semester

### Build Process
- ✅ Build now completes successfully with no errors
- ✅ All import errors resolved
- ✅ Environment variable issues fixed
- ✅ Icon compatibility issues resolved

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run build
# ✅ Build completes successfully
```

### Feature Testing
- ✅ Organization verification with semester selection
- ✅ File upload with proper metadata storage
- ✅ File download with access control
- ✅ Semester-based resource filtering

## 📋 Files Changed

### Core Files Modified
- `convex/schema.js` - Updated database schema
- `convex/org.js` - Added semester support
- `convex/knowledgeNest.js` - Implemented semester filtering
- `app/home/knowledge-nest/page.jsx` - Updated UI and form
- `components/FileUploadModal.jsx` - Removed class references
- `components/FileDisplayComponent.jsx` - Updated display logic
- `app/test/ultra-responsive/page.jsx` - Fixed Lightning icon usage

### API Routes Fixed
- `app/api/auth/get-user/route.js`
- `app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.js`
- `app/api/auth/send-otp/route.js`
- `app/api/org/send-otp/route.js`
- `app/api/download/route.js`
- `app/api/chat/route.js`

### New Files Added

- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive deployment instructions

## 🎯 Business Impact

### User Experience Improvements
- **Proper Resource Sharing**: Users now see files only from their semester cohort
- **Simplified Verification**: Removed unnecessary class field, focus on semester
- **Functional File Upload**: Knowledge Nest now works as intended
- **Successful Deployment**: Application can now be deployed without errors

### Security Enhancements
- **Stricter Access Control**: Files filtered by org + branch + semester
- **Environment Safety**: Graceful handling of missing configuration
- **Proper Validation**: Semester-based access validation

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

The application is now **deployment-ready** with:
- ✅ Successful build process
- ✅ Proper environment variable handling
- ✅ Functional file upload/download
- ✅ Semester-based resource sharing
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment documentation

## 🔄 Migration Notes

For existing deployments:
1. Update Convex schema to remove `class_sec` field
2. Set up environment variables as per `.env.local.example`
3. Users will need to re-verify with semester information

## 📚 Documentation

- Added comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Environment variable examples provided
- Step-by-step deployment instructions included
