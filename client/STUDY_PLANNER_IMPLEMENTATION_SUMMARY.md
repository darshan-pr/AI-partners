}
```

### **AI-Powered Analysis Algorithm**
```javascript
// Performance Analysis Process
1. Aggregate all ai_review entries for user
2. Extract weak/strong concepts with frequency analysis
3. Calculate weakness ratios for prioritization
4. Generate improvement suggestions
5. Create phased study plan structure
6. Assign time allocations based on difficulty
```

### **Study Plan Generation Phases**
1. **Foundation Building (20%)**: Basic concept review
2. **Targeted Improvement (50%)**: Focus on weak areas
3. **Reinforcement & Integration (20%)**: Strengthen knowledge
4. **Assessment & Review (10%)**: Progress evaluation

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Personalization**
- **Data-Driven**: Uses actual quiz performance data
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to user's weak and strong areas
- **Prioritized**: Focuses on highest-impact improvements
- **Timed**: Appropriate duration for each concept

### **User Experience**
- **Visual Roadmap**: Clear timeline progression
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion updates
- **Interactive**: Clickable completion toggles
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

### **Constraint Management**
- **Generation Limits**: Maximum 2 active planners per user
- **Expiration Handling**: Automatic cleanup of expired plans
- **Collision Prevention**: Prevents duplicate active planners

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### **Creating a Study Plan**
1. User clicks "Study Planner" on homepage
2. Modal opens with creation interface
3. User selects Weekly or Monthly plan
4. System analyzes user's quiz reviews
5. AI generates personalized study roadmap
6. Plan is displayed with timeline visualization

### **Managing Progress**
1. User opens active study plan
2. Views roadmap with connected tasks
3. Completes study activities
4. Marks tasks as complete
5. Progress percentage updates automatically
6. System tracks completion timestamps

### **Plan Expiration**
1. Plans automatically expire after set duration
2. Expired plans are marked as "expired"
3. Users can create new plans after expiration
4. System maintains history of completed plans
